## Installation

```bash
pip install autowired
```

## Quick Start

With _autowired_, everything is centered around context classes.     
A context can be viewed as a higher-level layer on top of a dependency injection container.
It can also be perceived as the in-code configuration of the application's components (e.g., services, controllers,
repositories, etc.). The concept of a context in _autowired_ is similar, though not identical, to the concept of a
module in other dependency injection frameworks.

Let's create a simple first example application.    
The demo application mimics a notification service that sends messages to users.    
We begin by defining the components of our application.

```python
class MessageService:
    def send_message(self, user: str, message: str):
        print(f"Sending message '{message}' to user '{user}'")


class UserService:
    def get_user(self, user_id: int) -> str:
        return f"User{user_id}"


class NotificationService:
    def __init__(self, message_service: MessageService, user_service: UserService):
        self.message_service = message_service
        self.user_service = user_service

    def send_notification(self, user_id: int, message: str):
        user = self.user_service.get_user(user_id)
        self.message_service.send_message(user, message)

```

Next, we'll define a context class for this application.    
The sole responsibility of this class is to set up the application components.

```python
from autowired import Context, autowired


class ApplicationContext(Context):
    notification_service: NotificationService = autowired()
```

Finally, we can utilize the context to access and use the application components.

```python
ctx = ApplicationContext()
ctx.notification_service.send_notification(1, "Hello, User!")
```

In our application code, we only interact with the `notification_service`, hence it's the only component we explicitly
define in the context class.

Note that the `ApplicationContext` is the only class that depends on the _autowired_ library.
All the components that implement the actual application logic are completely framework-agnostic and
don't require any special annotations or decorators.
This is a fundamental design principle of _autowired_.

Here are some other important things to point out:

1. Lazy instantiation:  
   `autowired` fields are instantiated lazily _by default_. This means they are instantiated the first time they are
   accessed.
   This can help reduce the startup time of your application and allows the use of a context even if some of its
   components cannot be instantiated (for example, due to missing configuration or unavailability of external services).
2. Singletons:  
   _By default_, `autowired` fields and all implicit dependencies are singletons.
   This implies that the same instance is returned every time they are accessed or injected.

In this initial example, _autowired_ did all the work for us.
However, in most real-world applications, you will need more control over the instantiation process.
The following sections will explain all the necessary concepts and advanced features in more detail.

## Core Principles

### Dependency Injection without Frameworks

[Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) is a simple yet powerful concept designed to
improve the decoupling of components in code. Although
it's often associated with certain frameworks, its implementation doesn’t necessarily require one.

Python's standard library already provides the necessary tools for implementing Dependency Injection (DI).  
One approach involves defining a central context class, which manages the dependencies between components. These
components are
presented as properties of this context class, each tying to the others during instantiation.

Typically, it's preferable for multiple components to share the same instance (often called
a [singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)) of a specific
dependency. In such cases, Python’s built-in `cached_property` decorator is an ideal solution. It functions by saving
the result of a property's initial call and then returns this cached value for any subsequent calls.    
This effectively provides all that's needed for a simple but elegant form of Dependency Injection in Python.

Let's look at a simple example:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from functools import cached_property


# define some components

class MessageService:
    def send_message(self, user: str, message: str):
        print(f"Sending message '{message}' to user '{user}'")


class UserService:
    def get_user(self, user_id: int):
        return f"User{user_id}"


@dataclass
class NotificationService:
    message_service: MessageService
    user_service: UserService
    all_caps: bool = False

    def send_notification(self, user_id: int, message: str):
        user = self.user_service.get_user(user_id)

        if self.all_caps:
            message = message.upper()

        self.message_service.send_message(user, message)


@dataclass
class NotificationController:
    notification_service: NotificationService

    def notify(self, user_id: int, message: str):
        print(f"Sending notification to user {user_id}")
        self.notification_service.send_notification(user_id, message)


# define a context class to manage the dependencies between components

class ApplicationContext:

    @cached_property
    def message_service(self) -> MessageService:
        return MessageService()

    @cached_property
    def user_service(self) -> UserService:
        return UserService()

    @cached_property
    def notification_service(self) -> NotificationService:
        return NotificationService(
            message_service=self.message_service,
            user_service=self.user_service
        )

    @cached_property
    def notification_controller(self) -> NotificationController:
        return NotificationController(
            notification_service=self.notification_service
        )


ctx = ApplicationContext()
ctx.notification_controller.notify(1, "Hello, User!")
```

In this setup, a `ApplicationContext` class is responsible for managing the dependencies between components.
Given that we want all our components to be singletons, we utilize the `cached_property` for each of them.

This approach is sufficient for many simple applications. However, as the application grows, the context class will
become increasingly bloated. You will have more components, and their interdependencies will become more complex. You
will also
have to deal with different scopes, e.g., request scoped components. This complexity can lead to a lot of boilerplate
code unrelated to the application logic and create opportunities for errors. _autowired_ aims to streamline this
process, while building on the same simple principles.

### Using autowired

Here's how the previous `ApplicationContext` could be rewritten using _autowired_:

```python
from autowired import Context, autowired


class ApplicationContext(Context):
    notification_controller: NotificationController = autowired()

```

We have simplified the context class to a single line of code.
As the `NotificationController` was the only component
that needed to be exposed as a public property, it is the only one we explicitly define.
_autowired_ now handles the instantiation of all components and their dependencies for us.
Components can be either dataclasses or traditional classes, provided they are appropriately annotated with type hints
for _autowired_ to automatically resolve their dependencies.

## Leveraging `cached_property` and `property` methods

Sometimes, you need more control over the instantiation process. For instance, the NotificationService has a
boolean parameter `all_caps`. We might want a configuration file that enables or disables this feature.  
Here's how we can do this using _autowired_:

```python
# We define a dataclass to represent our application settings
@dataclass
class ApplicationSettings:
    all_caps_notifications: bool = False


class ApplicationContext(Context):
    notification_controller: NotificationController = autowired()

    # we add a constructor to the context class to allow passing the settings
    def __init__(self, settings: ApplicationSettings = ApplicationSettings()):
        self.settings = settings

    @cached_property
    def _notification_service(self) -> NotificationService:
        # we use `self.autowire()` to resolve the dependencies of the notification service,
        # while passing a subset of the dependencies explicitly as kwargs
        return self.autowire(
            NotificationService,
            all_caps=self.settings.all_caps_notifications
        )


settings = ApplicationSettings(all_caps_notifications=True)
ctx = ApplicationContext(settings=settings)
ctx.notification_controller.notify(1, "Hello, User!")

assert ctx.notification_controller.notification_service.all_caps == True
```

As mentioned before, _autowired_ builds on the idea of using `cached_property` to implement the singleton pattern.
That's
why `cached_property` is a first-class citizen in _autowired_, and you can use it if you want to have more control over
the instantiation process. When _autowired_ resolves
dependencies, it respects not only other `autowired` fields but also `cached_property` and classic `property` methods.

The `Context` class provides a convenience method `self.autowire()` that you can use to resolve dependencies
within `cached_property` and `property` methods.
Explicit dependencies can be passed as kwargs, as shown in the example above, and the remaining ones will be resolved
automatically as before.

## Using kwargs factory for autowired fields

The previous example is equivalent to the following:

```python
class ApplicationContext(Context):
    notification_controller: NotificationController = autowired()
    _notification_service: NotificationService = autowired(
        lambda self: dict(all_caps=self.settings.all_caps_notifications)
    )

    def __init__(self, settings: ApplicationSettings = ApplicationSettings()):
        self.settings = settings
```

Here we pass a kwargs factory function to `autowired` as the first argument. The factory function is called with the
context instance as its only argument when the component is instantiated. This allows us to access the settings
via `self.settings`.

Which of the two approaches you prefer is a matter of taste or the complexity of evaluating the settings. For simple
settings, the kwargs factory function is probably the most convenient way. For more complex rules, the `cached_property`
approach might be more suitable. Both approaches can be mixed freely.

## Recap - The Building Blocks

We already covered the most important building blocks of _autowired_.

- `Context` serves as the base class for all classes that manage dependencies between components.
- `autowired` defines autowired fields.
- `cached_property` and `property` offer more control over the instantiation process.
- `self.autowire()` is a helper method for implementing `cached_property` and `property` methods on context classes.

## Eager and Lazy Instantiation

`autowired()` fields behave like `cached_property`s and are instantiated lazily, i.e., the first time they are accessed.
If this is not the desired behavior, you can use the `eager` parameter to force eager instantiation of the component.

```python
class ApplicationContext(Context):
    notification_controller: NotificationController = autowired(eager=True)
```

## Transient Components

There may be situations where you need to create a new instance of a component each time it's injected or accessed from
the context.
This is also known as a component with transient lifetime.
You can accomplish this by setting the `transient` parameter to `True` when defining an `autowired` field.

```python
class ApplicationContext(Context):
    notification_controller: NotificationController = autowired(transient=True)


ctx = ApplicationContext()

# A new instance is created each time the notification controller is accessed
assert id(ctx.notification_controller) != id(ctx.notification_controller)
```

For property methods, simply use the `property` decorator instead of `cached_property` to achieve the same effect.

## Scopes and Derived Contexts

Often a single context is not sufficient to manage all the dependencies of an application. Instead, many applications
will have multiple contexts, often sharing some components. A classic example is a request context, derived from an
application context.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from autowired import Context, autowired, provided


# an application scoped components

@dataclass
class AuthService:
    api_keys: list[str]

    def check_api_key(self, key: str) -> bool:
        return key in self.api_keys


# an example request object (e.g., from a web framework)
@dataclass
class Request:
    headers: dict[str, str]


# a request scoped component

@dataclass
class RequestService:
    auth_service: AuthService
    request: Request

    def is_authorised(self) -> bool:
        api_key = self.request.headers.get("Authorization") or ""
        api_key = api_key.replace("Bearer ", "")
        return self.auth_service.check_api_key(api_key)


# application settings and context

@dataclass
class ApplicationSettings:
    api_keys: list[str]


class ApplicationContext(Context):
    auth_service: AuthService = autowired(
        lambda self: dict(api_keys=self.settings.api_keys)
    )

    def __init__(self, settings: ApplicationSettings):
        self.settings = settings


# request scoped context

class RequestContext(Context):
    request_service: RequestService = autowired()
    # `provided` fields are not resolved automatically, but must be set explicitly in the constructor.
    # As `autowired` fields, `property`s and `cached_property`s, they are respected during dependency resolution.
    # If you forget to set them, _autowired_ will raise an exception on context instantiation.
    request: Request = provided()

    def __init__(self, parent_context: Context, request: Request):
        # We use `self.derive_from` to make the components of the parent context available in the request context.
        self.derive_from(parent_context)
        self.request = request


# example usage

settings = ApplicationSettings(api_keys=["123", "456"])
application_ctx = ApplicationContext(settings)


def create_request_context(request: Request):
    return RequestContext(application_ctx, request)


def request_handler(request: Request):
    ctx = create_request_context(request)
    if ctx.request_service.is_authorised():
        return "Authorised"
    else:
        raise Exception("Not authorised")


# applying the request handler to a dummy request

dummy_request = Request(headers={
    "Authorization": "Bearer 123"
})
response = request_handler(dummy_request)
print(response)

```

## The Container

Most of the time, using the `Context` class is sufficient for managing dependencies between components.
However, since it requires knowing upfront which components will be needed, it might not be suitable for all use cases.
Therefore, if you need more flexibility, you can use the `Container` class instead.
You can instantiate a container yourself or access a context's container via the `container` property.

```python
from autowired import Container


class MessageService:
    def send_message(self, user: str, message: str):
        print(f"Sending message '{message}' to user '{user}'")


class UserService:
    def get_user(self, user_id: int):
        return f"User{user_id}"


class NotificationService:
    def __init__(self, message_service: MessageService, user_service: UserService):
        self.message_service = message_service
        self.user_service = user_service

    def send_notification(self, user_id: int, message: str):
        user = self.user_service.get_user(user_id)
        self.message_service.send_message(user, message)


container = Container()
notification_service = container.resolve(NotificationService)

assert isinstance(notification_service, NotificationService)
assert notification_service is container.resolve(NotificationService)
assert notification_service.message_service is container.resolve(MessageService)
```

### Provider

A container can contain a list of providers (instances of the `Provider` class).
A provider is what actually creates the instances of a component.
Most of the time, especially when using the `Context` class, you don't need to worry about providers, as they are
created automatically.
The `Provider` class defines a simple interface that the `Container` class uses to resolve dependencies.

```python
class Provider(Generic[T]):

    def satisfies(self, dependency: Dependency) -> bool:
        # Checks whether the provider can provide an instances that satisfies the given dependency specification.
        ...

    def get_instance(self, dependency: Dependency, container: Container) -> T:
        # Returns an instance that satisfies the given dependency specification.
        ...

    def get_name(self) -> str:
        # Each provider has a name. The container utilises it to resolve ambiguous dependencies.
        ...

```    

Most providers are singleton component providers, i.e., they always return the same instance when `get_instance()` is
called.
In the above container usage example, when we resolved the `NotificationService` for the first time,
a singleton provider was
created automatically and added to the container.
However, you can also add providers manually.   
In most cases you use the `from_supplier` or `from_instance` factory methods to create a provider,
but you can also implement your own `Provider` subclass.
In the following example, we use the `from_supplier` factory method to create a transient provider for a custom
`MessageService` class.

```python
from autowired import Container, Provider

container = Container()


class AllCapsMessageService(MessageService):
    def send_message(self, user: str, message: str):
        super().send_message(user, message.upper())


def create_message_service() -> MessageService:
    return AllCapsMessageService()


# Using `from_supplier` calls the given supplier function each time 
# Note that the return type annotation on the supplier function is mandatory
# unless you specify the type argument explicitly
container.add(Provider.from_supplier(create_message_service))

assert isinstance(container.resolve(MessageService), AllCapsMessageService)
assert container.resolve(MessageService) is not container.resolve(MessageService)

```

## Example Application - FastAPI

The following example shows how to use _autowired_ in a FastAPI application.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from autowired import Context, autowired, provided


# Components

class DatabaseService:
    conn_str: str

    def load_allowed_tokens(self):
        return ["123", "456", ""]

    def get_user_name_by_id(self, user_id: int) -> str | None:
        print(f"Loading user {user_id} from database {self.conn_str}")
        d = {1: "John", 2: "Jane"}
        return d.get(user_id)


@dataclass
class UserService:
    db_service: DatabaseService

    def get_user_name_by_id(self, user_id: int) -> str | None:
